From the error logs in your screenshots and the workflow configuration, the issue seems to be with the shivammathur/setup-php@v2 action and the PHP version specified in your workflow file. The php-version: ^8.1 syntax may not be recognized correctly by the setup-php action.
  Steps to Fix the Issue
  1. Use a Specific PHP Version
  
  Instead of using ^8.1, specify an exact PHP version. The caret (^) is not a valid syntax for the php-version field in the shivammathur/setup-php action.

Update your workflow file to:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: 8.1
          extensions: tokenizer, xml, intl
